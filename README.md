# Health-OCD-Patient-Data-SQL-Power-BI

This project is a beginner-friendly health analytics portfolio project focused on analyzing hospital patient data using SQL and Power BI. The goal is to generate actionable insights from raw healthcare data to support data-driven decision-making.

As part of this health analytics project, I worked with a rough dataset on OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) patients to generate meaningful insights. The analysis included visualizing key patterns such as the "Sum of Patient Count by Month", which helped identify temporal trends and potential seasonal spikes in OCD-related hospital visits. The "Sum of Patient Count by Ethnicity" chart provided an understanding of how OCD impacts different ethnic groups, while the "Sum of Patient Count by Compulsion Type" visual revealed the most common compulsive behaviors among patients. To further explore the relationship between severity and frequency, a scatter plot of Obsession Count against Average Obsession Score was developed. Lastly, the "Sum of Patient Count by Gender" visualization offered insights into gender-based patterns in OCD diagnoses. These findings help inform mental health professionals and healthcare administrators in resource planning and targeted interventions.
